## DeeCSS 0.1.0
###### An efficient CSS-HTML framework

My custom CSS with the intention of replacing Bootstrap. This project was created from scratch. Main goals: everything should be responsive/fluid; should have a low learning curve; should use only things you actually need.

#### Features:

- A fluid CSS grid system
- HTML starter template
- Class selectors to solve common design tasks

#### TODO:

- Add CSS buttons
- Improve README
- Add API documentation
- Add custom attributes
- Customize grid classes for different screen sizes (i.e. small, medium, large screens)
- Add support for mobile and touchpads
- Add test/example HTML (instead of just boilerplate template)
