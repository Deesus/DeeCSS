## DeeCSS 0.1.1
###### An efficient CSS-HTML framework

My custom CSS with the intention of replacing Bootstrap. This project was created from scratch. 
Main goals: design should be veritably responsive; should have a low learning curve; should solve common design issues.

#### Features:

- A fluid CSS grid system
- HTML starter template
- Class selectors to solve common design tasks

#### TODO:

- **Refactor**:
    + [ ] Consolidate Sass
    + [ ] Boilerplate should include sticky footer wrapper and CSS
    + [ ] Separate menus, buttons, etc. into different CSS and different partials
- **Documentation**:
    + [ ] Improve README
    + [ ] Add API documentation
    + [ ] Show file structure
    + [ ] Add showcase/example HTML (instead of just boilerplate template)
- **Functionality**:
    + [ ] Add CSS buttons
    + [ ] Add menus
    + [ ] Add (more) utility functions
    + [ ] Add typography
- **Major/structural changes**:
    + [ ] Customize grid classes (e.g. "lg-4" or "sm-4") for different screen sizes (i.e. small, medium, large screens)
    + [ ] Make adaptive (`@media` for desktop, mobile, touchpad versions)
    + [ ] Make responsive to screen size -- c.f. Bootstrap, Heroku, or Tumblr
    + [ ] C.f. Gumby, Skeleton, and Pure frameworks for additional implementation ideas
    + [ ] Include standard dependencies: Modernizr, normalize.css [CSS reset], etc.
