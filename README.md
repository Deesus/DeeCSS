## DeeCSS 0.1.1
###### An efficient CSS-HTML framework

My custom CSS with the intention of replacing Bootstrap. This project was created from scratch. Main goals: everything should be responsive/fluid; should have a low learning curve; should use only things you actually need.

#### Features:

- A fluid CSS grid system
- HTML starter template
- Class selectors to solve common design tasks

#### TODO:

+ [ ] Consolidate Sass
+ [ ] Boilerplate should include sticky footer wrapper and CSS
+ [ ] Add CSS buttons
+ [ ] Improve README
+ [ ] Add API documentation
+ [ ] Add custom attributes
+ [ ] Customize grid classes (e.g. "lg-4" or "sm-4") for different screen sizes (i.e. small, medium, large screens)
+ [ ] Make adaptive (desktop, mobile, touchpad versions)
+ [ ] Add test/example HTML (instead of just boilerplate template)
+ [ ] Make responsive to screen size -- c.f. Bootstrap, Heroku, or Tumblr
